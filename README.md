# Parallel-Merge-Sort-Implementation
This report details a parallel merge sort in C using memory-mapped I/O and a fork/join model. The program sorts 64-bit integers from a file. Performance analysis reveals significant speedup with increased parallelism, but also shows that excessive process management overhead eventually degrades performance.
